## Project Overview


This repository contains performance tests for the [QuickPizza API](https://quickpizza.grafana.com/), implemented using [k6](https://k6.io/). The tests demonstrate:

The test suite is designed with modularity and maintainability in mind, leveraging TypeScript for type safety and a clean project structure separating configuration, test scenarios, models, and utility classes. Workloads and scenarios are configurable via environment variables, allowing flexible execution in local and CI environments.

---

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the QuickPizza API performance tests locally:

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [k6](https://k6.io/) (can be installed via npm or your OS package manager)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/randonNaidoo/quickpizza-performance-tests.git
   cd quickpizza-performance-tests
   ```
1. Install npm dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
1. Install k6:
   ```bash
   npm install -g k6
   ```

## üöÄ Running Tests

Use npm scripts to run tests with different scenarios:

- Smoke test:
   ```bash
   npm run testSmoke
   ```
- Average load test:
   ```bash
   npm run testAverage
   ```

- Spike load test:
   ```bash
   npm run testSpike
   ```
